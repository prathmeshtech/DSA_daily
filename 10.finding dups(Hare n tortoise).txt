Find the duplicate in an array of N+1 integers
Problem Statement: Given an array of N + 1 size, where each element is between 1 and N. Assuming there is only one duplicate number, your task is to find the duplicate number.

Example 1: 
Input: arr=[1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Solution 1:Using sorting

Solution 2:Using frequency array

Approach: Take a frequency array of size N+1 and initialize it to 0. Now traverse through the
 array and if the frequency of the element is 0 increase it by 1, else if the frequency is not
 0 then that element is the required answer.


Solution 3: Floyd's Hare and Tortoise method.

int findDuplicate(vector < int > & nums) {
  int slow = nums[0];
  int fast = nums[0];
  do {
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[nums[fast]];
  } while (slow != fast);
  fast = nums[0];
  while (slow != fast) {
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[fast];
  }
  return slow;
}
